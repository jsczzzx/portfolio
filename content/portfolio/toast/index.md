- Developed the "Explore" page, a core feature that allowed users to browse and 
search restaurants, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
- Used **RxJS Observables** and **HttpClient Service** to make API calls. Leveraged 
RxJS operators including **debounce** and **switchMap** to ensure the UI remains 
responsive without throttling performance.

of the page, optimizing the performance of the application.
- Resolved **cross-browser compatibility issues**. Utilized **BrowserStack** for 
extensive testing, and implemented **polyfills** and **CSS resets** to standardize 
behavior across platforms.
- Partnered with UI/UX designers to integrate **Accessibility** into the design 
process. Developed accessible color palettes with sufficient contrast ratios 
to aid users with visual impairments. Utilized **WAVE** to identify and address 
accessibility issues.
- Utilized Flexible Layouts, Media Queries, Relative Units and Responsive 
Typography to ensure **Responsive Web Design**, delivering a seamless user 
experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Familiar with **CI/CD** pipeline using **Jenkins**. Conducted unit testing using 
**Jasmine** and **Karma**, and end-to-end testing using **Cypress** to ensure the 
robustness and reliability of the application.
